This project, Retail Sales Analysis (SQL Project), showcases SQL-based data analysis on a retail dataset using MySQL syntax. It includes a complete workflow covering the creation and population of a sales table, querying with SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY clauses, and performing INNER, LEFT, and RIGHT JOINs. Advanced filtering is demonstrated using subqueries, and business insights are derived using aggregate functions such as SUM and AVG. The project further enhances data access through views and improves performance through indexing. The entire project was developed using the DB Fiddle online SQL environment (https://www.db-fiddle.com/) and documented in Microsoft Word. To explore or replicate this project, open DB Fiddle, copy the SQL schema and queries from the report, and execute each block step by step to view the results. This project is ideal for students or professionals learning SQL for analytics and optimization.
